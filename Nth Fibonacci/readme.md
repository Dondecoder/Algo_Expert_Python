# Name 

Nth Fibonacci

## Type of Question

Recursion

## Difficulty

Easy

## Description

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is `0`, the second number is `1`, and the nth number is the sum of the `(n - 1)`th and `(n - 2)`th numbers. Write a function that takes in an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

Important note: the Fibonacci sequence is often defined with its first two numbers as `F0 = 0` and `F1 = 1`. For the purpose of this question, the first Fibonacci number is `F0`; therefore, `getNthFib(1)` is equal to `F0`, `getNthFib(2)` is equal to `F1`, etc..

## How I approached the problem

To solve this problem recursively we have to find which will be the nth in the Fibonacci sequence in order to do that we have to write a function. The Nth number is equal to the sum of: `(n-1) and (n-2)`. Each node needs to be put through the recurssive formula the solution for this is very simple in understanding as long as you go through each step in the recursive solution.
